<h3>Features</h3>
Next.js Frontend: Utilizes Next.js, a React framework, to build the frontend. This enables server-side rendering, efficient client-side routing, and an optimized development experience.

Django Backend: Integrates Django, a high-level Python web framework, to handle backend functionalities. Django offers robust database management, URL routing, and powerful data processing capabilities.

API Communication: Demonstrates how to establish communication between the Next.js frontend and Django backend through API endpoints. This allows for efficient data exchange and separation of concerns between the frontend and backend.

Authentication and Authorization: Implements user authentication and authorization using Django's built-in authentication system. Users can sign up, log in, and access different parts of the application based on their roles and permissions.

Responsive Design: Ensures that the application is responsive and works well on different screen sizes and devices. CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS can be used for styling.
