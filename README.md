<h3>Features</h3>
<h4>Next.js Frontend</h4>: Utilizes Next.js, a React framework, to build the frontend. This enables server-side rendering, efficient client-side routing, and an optimized development experience.

<h4>Django Backend:</h4> Integrates Django, a high-level Python web framework, to handle backend functionalities. Django offers robust database management, URL routing, and powerful data processing capabilities.

<h4>API Communication:</h4> Demonstrates how to establish communication between the Next.js frontend and Django backend through API endpoints. This allows for efficient data exchange and separation of concerns between the frontend and backend.

<h4>Authentication and Authorization:</h4> Implements user authentication and authorization using Django's built-in authentication system. Users can sign up, log in, and access different parts of the application based on their roles and permissions.

<h4>Responsive Design:</h4> Ensures that the application is responsive and works well on different screen sizes and devices. CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS can be used for styling.
